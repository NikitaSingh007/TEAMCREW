3. Stresses in beams; shear force (SF), axial force and bending moment (BM); differential
relations for BM, SF and load; SF and BM diagrams; bending stresses in straight beams –
symmetric loading; stresses in beams of various cross sections; stresses in built-up beams and
beams of different materials.
