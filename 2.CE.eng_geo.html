        <h2>SYLLABUS</h2>
      <pre>Geology and its importance in Civil Engineering.
Mineralogy: Definition, internal and external structure of minerals, study of crystals, Classification and physical
properties of minerals.
Classification of rocks: Igneous rocks: Origin, mode of occurrence, forms & texture, classification and engineering
importance.
Sedimentary rocks: Process of sedimentation, classification and engineering importance. Metamorphic rocks: Agents
and types of metamorphism, classification and engineering importance.
Weathering of rocks: Agents and kinds of weathering, soil formation & classification based on origin.
Geological work of rivers: Origin and stages in the system, erosion, transportation and deposition. Structural geology:
Introduction to structural elements of rocks, dip & strike, definition, description, classification of folds, faults and
joints, importance of geological structures in Civil Engineering.
Earthquakes and seismic hazards: Causes and effects, seismic waves and seismographs, Mercelli’s intensity scale and
Richter’s scale of magnitude. Engineering properties of rocks: Porosity, permeability, compressive strength, tensile
strength and abrasive resistance.
