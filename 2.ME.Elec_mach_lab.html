        <h2>SYLLABUS</h2>
      <pre>
        At least 6 (six) of the following experiments are to be conducted.
1. Study of the characteristics of a separately excited DC generator.
2. Study of the characteristics of a DC motor
3. Study of the characteristics of a compound DC generator (short shunt).
4. Measurement of speed of DC series motor as a function of load torque.
5. Speed control of 3 phase Induction motor by different methods & their comparison.
6. Determination of regulation of Alternator by Synchronous Impedance method.
7. Determination of equivalent circuit parameters of a single phase motor.
8. Load test of single phase Induction motor to obtain the performance characteristics.
9. Study of equivalent circuit of three phase induction motor by no load and blocked rotor test.
10. Study of performance of three phase squirrel- cage Induction motor â€“determination of Iron-loss, friction &
windage loss.
